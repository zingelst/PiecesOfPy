# PiecesOfPy

A collection of simple worked examples in Python. I'll usually start with one
of these as a template and customize to whatever I need it to do

## Cmd
`argparse_subparse.py` - An example of using ArgParse with subcommands like docker does.

## Web
`simple_web.py` - A basic Python web server that handles reqeusts, but no file serving or anything else. Essentially a starting point for a simple REST service.

## matplotlib
`plotting.py` - A snippet of how to do some simple plotting and axis/chart formatting in matplotlib. I always forget the bits to do this correctly.
